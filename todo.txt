V 1.) Get config file working:
    *Group patches together that need 
    to be patched in a particular order.

2.) Get patches into program:
    *Parse config file.

    *Load patch identifiers into memory 
    in the right order as specified in 
    the config file.

3.) Find optimal patch configuration:
    *Disect every patch into its components.

    *Create library for files. Key=filename,
    value=array of patch components.

    *Make sure the arrays are sorted from
    farthest to closest from the beginning of the file.

4.) Apply patches:
    *Try to apply patches with python script,
    not "git apply"
